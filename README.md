You can also check this video showing how to do it:

**Important note:** if you have already added the autosplitter through the **Layout** option, you should remove it from the layout so it won't have any conflict.

## ‚è≥ How to use it
- The timer must be **manually started by yourself**. Check the category rules to see when to start;
  - After starting, you won't have to bother  
- If you have **Split** enabled, it will automatically split as soon as it detects the **Victory/Defeat** Screen; 
  - In case you are playing **Galactic Conquest** and leave a map to loose on purpose, it won't split for you due to the game not showing you the **victory/defeat** screen;
  - Also in **GC**, in the current state, it won't split at the very last victory screen of the GC, showying you have beaten the **Galactic Conquest**. It must be done manually;
- If you enabled **Galactic Conquest**, it will use the load removal rules of GC only, pausing the timer just on actual loading screens;
- If you have **Other Game Modes** checked, it will use the same load removal rules of the rest of the categories, that pauses the timer on the victory/defeat screen and resumes after the game finishes loading the next map;
  - If both **Galactic Conquest** and **Other Game Modes** are enabled, it will use the **Galactic Conquest** ruleset;
- If by any chance you only want to Autosplitter function without the load removal, you can disable both **Galactic Conquest** and **Other Game Modes**. But keep in mind that all categories are timed removing the loading time.
